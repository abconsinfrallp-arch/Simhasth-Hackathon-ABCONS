ABCONS Technology – Smart River & Nala Management

Team ID: TH2025-ABCONS
Tagline: Innovating for a Sustainable Future ✨

 Overview

ABCONS Technology is a nature-based, patent-backed water treatment system that combines diatoms, floating bio-islands, UV disinfection, and IoT-based monitoring to restore river and nala water quality.
Built for Simhasth 2028, it ensures safe, clean, and sustainable water for millions of pilgrims while reducing O&M costs and carbon footprint.

🚩 Problem & ✅ Solution

Problem Statement
Rivers and nalas around Ujjain face severe pollution from untreated sewage, solid waste, and lack of real-time monitoring. This poses serious health, sanitation, and ecological risks during Simhasth.

Our Solution
ABCONS Technology integrates:

 Modular phycoremediation units using diatoms.

 IoT + SCADA monitoring for water quality.

 Floating bio-islands for ecological restoration.

 Decentralized UV disinfection channels.

 Real-time dashboards for authorities & citizens.

 Logic & Workflow

Data Collection → Real-time sensors (BOD, COD, DO, pH, turbidity, flow).

Processing → AI engine + diatom treatment + aeration + bio-islands.

Output → Clean water for safe religious & ecological use.

User Side → Pilgrims/citizens see live dashboards of water quality.

Admin Side → Authorities get SCADA control panel with IoT alerts.
