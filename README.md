# 🌊 ABCONS Technology – Smart River & Nala Management  

**Team ID:** TH2025-ABCONS  
**Tagline:** *Innovating for a Sustainable Future* ✨  

## 🔎 Overview  
ABCONS Technology is a nature-based, patent-backed water treatment system combining diatoms, floating bio-islands, UV disinfection, and IoT-based monitoring to restore river and nala water quality.  
Built for Simhasth 2028, it ensures safe, clean, and sustainable water for millions of pilgrims while lowering O&M costs and reducing carbon footprint.  

## 🚩 Problem & ✅ Solution  

**Problem Statement**  
Rivers and nalas around Ujjain face severe pollution from untreated sewage, solid waste, and lack of real-time monitoring. This creates serious health, sanitation, and ecological risks during Simhasth.  

**Our Solution**  
ABCONS Technology integrates:  
- 🌱 Modular phycoremediation units using diatoms.  
- 📡 IoT + SCADA monitoring for water quality.  
- 🪴 Floating bio-islands for ecological restoration.  
- 💡 Decentralized UV disinfection channels.  
- 📊 Real-time dashboards for authorities & citizens.  

## ⚙️ Logic & Workflow  
1. **Data Collection** → Real-time sensors (BOD, COD, DO, pH, turbidity, flow).  
2. **Processing** → AI engine + diatom treatment + aeration + bio-islands.  
3. **Output** → Clean water for safe religious & ecological use.  
4. **User Side** → Pilgrims/citizens view live dashboards of water quality.  
5. **Admin Side** → Authorities access SCADA control panel with IoT alerts.  

## 💻 Tech Stack  
- Frontend: React.js + Tailwind CSS  
- Backend: Node.js + Express  
- Database: MongoDB / PostgreSQL  
- AI/Processing: Python (water quality prediction, diatom optimization)  
- IoT/Monitoring: Arduino / Raspberry Pi + SCADA sensors  
- APIs: Google Maps API, ThingSpeak/IoT Cloud  
- Hosting: Firebase / AWS  

## 🚀 Future Scope  
- 🤖 AI-powered predictive maintenance for treatment systems.  
- 📱 Mobile app integration for citizens & pilgrims.  
- 🌍 Multi-city scalability across India’s rivers & nalas.  
- 🔗 Blockchain for water quality transparency.  
- 🇮🇳 Alignment with Clean Ganga Mission and Smart Cities programs.
